{"type":"cell","id":"0472f5","pos":5,"input":"To study Newton's rings we analyze the waves reflected in the sheet of variable thickness (usually of air) that is formed by depositing a plano-convex lens on a flat surface, as shown in the following figure. The radius of curvature of the lens is $ R $. As we move away from the center (point of contact) the thickness of the air layer increases. We stay at a distance $ x $ from the center. At that distance the thickness of the air layer is $ e $. If we illuminate the system from above with a collimated beam of wavelength $ \\lambda $, the wave reflected on the lower face of the plano-convex lens and the reflected wave on the upper face of the flat surface interfere. And they do it as if it were a thin sheet of thick $ e $. Considering incidents very close to normal, the path difference between these two waves will be:\n\n$$ \\Delta = 2 e $$\n\nand therefore the phase shift\n\n$$ \\delta = \\frac {2 \\pi} {\\lambda} 2 e + \\pi $$\n\nwhere we have included an offset of $ \\pi $ due to the reflections, since one wave is reflected in the glass-air interface and the other is the opposite (air-glass).\n\nThe phase difference between the two waves depends on the thickness of the air layer. This thickness increases as we move away from the center so that the interference condition will also vary, passing through maxima ($ \\delta = 2m \\pi $) and minimum $ \\delta = (2m + 1) \\pi $ of light.\n\nRight at the center or point of contact the thickness is zero. So the offset will be $ \\pi $, the one corresponding to the reflections, and we will have the waves interfere destructively. That is why at the point of contact a minimum of light will be observed.","cell_type":"markdown"}

The distance or separation between consecutive dark rings is not fixed, and that is why the interflange is not mentioned. In particular the distance between the ring of order $ m $ and $ m + 1 $ is\n\n$$ x_ {m + 1} - x_m = \\sqrt {\\lambda R} \\left (\\sqrt {m + 1} - \\sqrt {m} \\right) $$\n\nWith this expression we can easily verify that the distance between the dark rings near the center\n$ (x_2-x_1 \\simeq 0.4 \\sqrt {\\lambda R}) $ is greater than the distance between dark rings away from the center\n$ (x_ {12} -x_ {11} \\simeq 0.15 \\sqrt {\\lambda R}) $. That is to say, that the rings come together when moving away from the center, as we already explained at the beginning of this document.\n\nThis interferometric technique allows to determine the radius of curvature of the lens $ R $ by measuring the radii of the dark rings $ x_m $. For example, with the radius of the first dark ring: $ R = x_1 ^ 2 / \\lambda $. The usual way is to graphically represent the radius squared of the dark rings according to the order or number of the ring ($ m $). By means of a linear adjustment, the slope of the adjustment line will allow us to obtain the value of the radius of the lens, $ slope = \\lambda R $.","cell_type":"markdown"}

The relationship between the sides of the triangle is:\n\n$$ R ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + (R-e) ^ 2 $$\n\nWe are considering that the air layer is thin and therefore the thickness will be much smaller than the value of the radius of the lens $ R $. So we can write $ (R-e) ^ 2 = R ^ 2 + e ^ 2 - 2 and R \\simeq R ^ 2 - 2 e R $, that is, neglect $ e ^ 2 $. Therefore we have left\n\n$$ R ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + R ^ 2 - 2 and R $$\n\nand by clearing the thickness of the previous expression we get\n\n$$ e = \\frac {x ^ 2} {2R} $$\n\nthat is, the thickness varies parabolically with the distance to the center. In addition, the thickness variation is more noticeable when the radius of the lens is smaller. That is, the radius of the lens will influence how the thickness of the air sheet varies and therefore in the resulting light distribution.\n\nIf we use the previous thickness in the phase difference between the two waves, we finally obtain\n\n$$ \\delta = \\frac {2 \\pi} {\\lambda} 2 \\frac {x ^ 2} {2R} + \\pi $$","cell_type":"markdown"}

{"type":"cell","id":"fd0d62","pos":2,"input":"The interference pattern that appears when light is reflected between two transparent surfaces, a curve and a flat one, is known as Newton's Rings.\n\nThe pattern consists of a set of rings centered at the point of contact of the two surfaces. These are strips of light of equal thickness, that is, each ring represents the region in which the thickness between the two surfaces is the same. The thickness of the sheet that is enclosed between the two surfaces increases more quickly when moving away from the center (point of contact). Therefore the rings furthest from the center are closer together.\n\nThis technique is used to evaluate the quality of optical surfaces, see the following article on the characterization of ophthalmic lenses as an example.","cell_type":"markdown"}
