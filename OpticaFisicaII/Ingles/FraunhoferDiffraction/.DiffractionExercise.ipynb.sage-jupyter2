Theoretical basis\n\n** Fraunhofer Diffraction **\n\nDiffraction is the tendency of every wave to depart from straight propagation as it propagates or passes through an opening or obstacle.\nThis effect is basically the result of interferential processes and therefore is intimately related to the wave nature of light.\nFor its study we are going to make use of the Huygens-Fresnel Principle,it is necessary to emphasize that it is an approximation.\nFor a complete treatment of diffraction we must turn to Maxwell's equations. However, the use of the Huygens-Fresnel principle will give us\nmore than enough results. Said principle says the following:\n    \nEach point of the wavefront can be assumed as a secondary emitter center of spherical waves. The total disturbance that reaches another point\nSubsequent is the result of the interference of all those secondary waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2.1 Diffraction through a slit\n\nDue to the effect of diffraction the irradiance at a point on an observation plane in the Fraunhofer region is given by:\n    \n  $$ I (\\beta) = I_0 \\frac{\\sin^ 2 (\\beta)} {\\beta ^ 2} $$ (1)\n\nwhere beta is defined as:\n    \n  $$ \\beta = \\frac{\\pi b \\sin (\\theta)} {\\lambda} $$ (2)\n\nb being the width of the aperture and theta the angle subtended by the observation point with respect to the axis normal to the plane of the slit. In these\nconditions have that D >> x so $ \\sin (\\theta) ≈ tan (\\theta) ≈ x / D $. Therefore the expression of $\\beta$ given by equation (2) can\nApproach to:\n           \n  $$ \\beta = \\frac{\\pi b x} {\\lambda D} $$ (3)\n    \nwhere x is the distance from the point considered to the Y axis.\nIn this way, diffraction minima will be obtained when $ I (\\beta) = 0 $. This occurs in those positions where $ \\beta $ is a whole multiple\nof $ \\pi: \\beta = m \\pi $, with m = ± 1, ± 2, ... since in the case of m = 0 there is a maximum called the diffraction central maximum.\nTaking into account the minimum condition and the $\\beta$ equation, the position of the minimum order m is given by:\n        \n  $$ x_m = \\frac{\\lambda D} {b} m $$ (4)\n\n(A) Schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the simple slit\n\n(B) Radiation profile on the screen","cell_type":"markdown","collapsed":true}
{"type":"cell","id":"806bb8","pos":5,"input":"### 2.2 Diffraction through a circular aperture\n\nWhen striking a beam of light over a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern that is observed consists of a series of circular stripes\nconcentric The phenomenon is similar to that of a slit, in fact we could consider the circular opening as a collection of slits of\nvariable length that fill all the opening. At a given point on the screen the resulting irradiance is obtained by the coherent sum of\nthe contributions of each of the elementary slits. This results in the expression of the irradiance being slightly different from the\nexpression (1) and is given by:\n\n   $$ I (\\theta) = I (0) \\left (\\frac {2 J_1 \\left (ka \\sin \\left (\\theta \\right) \\right)} {ka \\sin (\\theta)} \\right) ^ 2 $$ (6)\n\nwhere a is the radius of the circular opening, $ \\theta $ the angular position of the observation point on the screen relative to the center of the aperture and\n$ k = 2 \\pi / \\lambda $ is the number of waves.
