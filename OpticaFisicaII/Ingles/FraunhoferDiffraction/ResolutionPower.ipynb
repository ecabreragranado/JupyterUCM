    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how the diffraction determines that the irradiance in a screen located after an opening, will not have the spatial distribution fixed by the geometric shadow of said opening. The beam opens and shows maximum and minimum on the screen. This observation can be interpreted by applying the Huygens-Fresnel principle, that is, calculating the interference of the secondary waves emitted by each point of the wave front that the aperture allows to pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also seen previously that in the particular case of a circular opening, the distribution of irradiance on the screen is known as Airy disk, characterized by a central maximum where most of the energy is distributed and lateral lobes less and less intense . Due to this profile, the size of the Airy spot is usually specified by giving the diameter (or radius) of the first dark ring, or the angle subtended with the optical axis by this minimum from the opening if the sizeis expressed in angular units.\n",
    "\n",
    "This value of the angle that gives the position of the first minimum of the Airy disk follows the expression,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_1 = \\frac {1.22 \\lambda} {\\Phi} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\lambda $ is the wavelength that illuminates the system and $ \\Phi $ is the diameter of the aperture.\n",

    "----------\n",

    "This distribution of irradiance caused by a circular aperture takes great importance when introducing the effects of diffraction on the formation of the image of an optical system. Indeed, every optical system has a finite transversal dimension, normally given by the size of the included lenses or diaphragms. This finite size causes the beam coming from an object from which one wants to form its image to be cut at its entrance to the system, thus appearing the diffraction effects discussed in this topic. The result is that the prediction made by Geometric Optics for a perfect optical system by which the image of a point is a point is no longer valid for diffraction. By including this effects, the image of a point will be a smear of diffraction. On the other hand, and given that most of the lenses and diaphragms used have a circular shape, this spot will be the Airy disk discussed above."

    "# Limitation on the resolution of two specific objects nearby\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily understand that, if the image of a point is not another point due to diffraction, but is a spatial distribution of irradiance with a certain extension, the images of two nearby objects can overlap each other in the image plane, resulting in a slightly larger stain. In this way, we may not be able to distinguish the images of those two nearby points. In other words, the fact that diffraction imposes a certain size on the image of an object point given by an optical system, limits the ability of the system to solve two nearby object points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rayleigh criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "Although distinguishing between two superimposed images can be somewhat subjective, a criterion has been developed to discriminate if two images are sufficiently separated from each other so that we can say that the system solves those two points. This criterion is called ** Rayleigh criterion ** and according to it * two images are resolved if, at least, the separation between the maxima of the Airy spots is equal to the radius of the first minimum *.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code calculates the images given by a lens of two points near objects. The distance between these points, the wavelength, the focal length of the lens or the distance to the lens can be modified. In the figure, a profile of the irradiance in the image plane is shown next to the reference that marks the separation imposed by the Rayleigh criterion so that two points are resolved. Also on the right is the 2D image of what we would observe on the screen."
