    "The Geometric Optics (GO) provides very useful tools to analyze optical systems. However, the model of propagation of light by means of rays does not include the effects due to the wave character of the light. In particular, the OG predicts for a stigmatic system that the image of a point O located in the object plane is another point O 'located in the image plane. This image does not exactly correspond to reality. In perfect optical systems (free of aberrations), it is found that the image of a point is an extensive spot, due to the diffraction suffered by the light wave. This effect happens whenever the light passes through an optical system that partially obstructs the wave fronts due to the presence of diaphragms or because of the finite size of the lenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example of diffraction is the passage of light through a circular aperture. In this case, a composite circular stain can be seen on a screen behind the lens.\n",
    "by different rings, and called Airy spot. The angle subtended by the first minimum irradiance is where D is the diameter of the aperture and $ \\lambda $ is the wavelength of the light. Due to the widespread use of circular lenses and diaphragms, this figure will appear as an O 'image of an object point O in a system free of aberrations, thus moving away from the predictions of the GO and limiting the resolution of two object points very close to each other. .\n",
    "\n",
    "![Airy stain](283px-Airy-pattern.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This representative case allows to show that diffraction will play an important role in the formation of the image. When we take into account these effects in the calculation of the image given by an optical system we speak of diffraction theory of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the formation of the image of large objects, two alternative approaches can be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The image of the extended object is formed by the composition of the images of each of the points that make up the object. In this approach, the fundamental element that allows us to obtain the global image given by the system is the image of a single object point. This image is called the Point Dispersion Function (PSF). Knowing this information, we can reconstruct the whole image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The extended object can be decomposed into sinusoidal frames or networks of different period and different orientation. The image results from the composition of all the images corresponding to each of these frames. In other words, the response of the system in the frequency space is analyzed. This approach will lead us to define the Optical Transfer Function (OTF), the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and the Phase Transfer Function (PTF)."

    "The Point Spread Function (PSF) of an optical system provides the image of a point object given by that system. Knowing what image we obtain from a single point, we can deduce the global image of an extended object. The deduction of the irradiance in the image we obtain when considering a specific object is not complicated and can be consulted in more specialized books such as  [Introduction to Fourier Optics de Joseph W. Goodman](http://cisne.sim.ucm.es/search~S6*spi?/Xintroduction+to+fourier+optics&SORT=D/Xintroduction+to+fourier+optics&SORT=D&SUBKEY=introduction+to+fourier+optics/1%2C32%2C32%2CB/frameset&FF=Xintroduction+to+fourier+optics&SORT=D&1%2C1%2C)\n",

    "The main result is that the Point Dispersion Function is proportional to the square of the Fourier transform of the pupil function of our optical system. That is to say,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ PSF (x, y) \\propto | FT [P (x, y)] | ^ 2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the pubic function, for the case of a single lens, takes the value 1 inside the lens, and 0 outside it. This operation gives us for this case that the PSF is the function of Airy, which is already known within the framework of the diffraction produced by a circular opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of the above is that diffraction imposes a final resolution limit for optical systems. Even in a system completely free of aberrations, the image of a point is not a point, but a more or less extensive spot, depending on the diameter of the lens. When the images of two very close points overlap, they can not be distinguished, there being a minimum angle of resolution to discriminate two point object points. The criterion most commonly used to decide whether two nearby points are resolvable by an optical system is the so-called Rayleigh criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead of a point object we have a large object, each point of the object will give rise to a diffraction spot in the image. We can interpret it as if each point of the image given by the Geometric Optics was replaced by the PSF of the system, resulting in a detriment to the quality of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the object is represented by its irradiance distribution O (x, y), the irradiance in a point of the image plane I (u, v) will be obtained by adding the contribution of all the images of each of the points of the object. When considering incoherent illumination, this sum is made on the irradiances resulting from the image of each point of the observation plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I (u, v) = O (x_0, y_0) PSF (u - x_0, v -y_0) + O (x_1, y_1) PSF (u - x_1, v -y_1) + \\ldots $$\n",
