Before an audience mainly defending the corpuscular theory of light (supported by Isaac Newton), Thomas Young carried out the first experiment of interference of light, demonstrating the wave nature of light. He let a ray of sunlight through a small hole in the window of the room and made the beam of light fall on the edge of a card dividing the beam in two. These two beams when overlapping on a screen generated dark and bright bands of light.\n\n[1] Thomas Young, \"Experimental Demonstration of the General Law of the Interference of Light,\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London vol. 94 (1804).","cell_type":"markdown"}
