The treatment with the first 2 waves reflected or transmitted is a valid approximation when the reflection coefficients are low. Otherwise, it is necessary to consider all the internal reflections produced in the sheet, and consequently, all the transmitted or reflected waves.\n\nLet's see what happens with the irradiance transmitted and reflected in this case.
