    "Thus Thomas Young began his famous experiment on November 24, 1803 at the Royal Society of London. Before an audience mainly defending the corpuscular theory of light (supported by Isaac Newton), Thomas Young carried out the first experiment of interference of light, demonstrating the wave nature of light. He let a ray of sunlight through a small hole in the window of the room and made the beam of light fall on the edge of a card dividing the beam in two. These two beams when overlapping on a screen generated dark and bright bands of light.\n",

    "Normally, Young's experiment is represented by a double slit, as shown in the previous figure. A spherical wave (or a flat wave, the treatment is equivalent), affects a screen on which two openings have been made $ S_1 $ and $ S_2 $ very close to each other (we will call the distance between them $ a $) . These openings act as two secondary sources of radiation, generating in turn two spherical waves that overlap in the space behind them. If we observe the distribution of irradiance on a screen located at a certain distance $ D $, what will we find?"
