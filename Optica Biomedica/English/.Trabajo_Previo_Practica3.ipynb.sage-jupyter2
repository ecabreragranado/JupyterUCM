By knowing the distance between the ilumination and detection fibers $r$ (cm), the distances between the detector and the two sources (the one inside the tissue and the virtual one outside of it considered for boundary conditions) are:\n\n$$\\rho_1=\\sqrt{z_0^2 + r^2},$$\n$$\\rho_2 = \\sqrt{ \\left(z_0 + 4 A D \\right)^2 + r^2 }.$$\n\n$A$ is related to the refractive index variation at the interface between the tissue and the external medium: $A = (1 + R_{eff})/(1 - R_{eff})$, with $R_{eff} = - 1.440 / n_r^2 + 0.71 / n_r + 0.668 + 0.0636 n_r  $, being $n_r$ the tissue refractive index normalized by the external one. $T_{epi}$ is the transmittance of the epidermis which takes into account the melanin absorption\n\n$$T_{epi} = e^{ - Mel \\; \\mu_{a \\; mel} \\;  L_{epi} }$$  \n\n\nwhere $Mel$ is the epidermis melanin content, $L_{epi}=0.006*2$ cm is the propagation path of the light when entering and leaving the epidermis (by considering 60 $\\mu$m of epidermis), and last, $\\mu_{a \\; mel}$ is the melanine absorption coefficient (cm$^{-1}$):\n\n$$ \\mu_{a \\; mel} (cm^{-1})= \\frac{6.6 \\times 10^{11}} { [\\lambda(nm)]^{3.33}}$$ \n\nThe reduced scaterring coefficient $\\mu_{s}' = a (\\mu_{s \\; Mie}' + \\mu_{s \\; Ray.}')$ results from a combination of the Mie and Rayleigh scattering coefficients (cm$^{-1}$):\n\n$$ \\mu_{s \\; Mie}' (cm^{-1}) = 4.59 \\times 10^3 \\; [\\lambda(nm)]^{-0.913}$$\n$$ \\mu_{s \\; Ray.}' (cm^{-1})= 1.74 \\times 10^{12} \\; [\\lambda(nm)]^{-4}$$\n\nwhile $a$ is a constant which modifies the scattering amplitude. \n\nThe absroption coefficient (cm$^{-1}$) is mainly due to the hemoglobin and partially to the water:\n\n$$\\mu_a  = B \\; \\left( S \\; \\mu_{a \\; oxi} + ( 1 - S ) \\; \\mu_{a \\; desoxi}  \\right) + W \\; \\mu_{a \\; water}$$ \n\nwhere $B$ is the blood volume fraction in the tissue, $S$ is the blood oxygenation level, $\\mu_{a \\; oxi}$ and $\\mu_{a \\; desoxi}$ are the absorption coefficients of the oxyhemoglobin and the desoxyhemoglobin in blood, respectively,  $W$ is the water volume fraction in the tissue and $\\mu_{a \\; water}$ the water absorption coefficient.\n","cell_type":"markdown"}
